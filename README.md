# News-category-classifier

A Bidirectional LSTM and Attention model capable of detecting News categories.

* This model is trained to generalize a set of not-yet annotated News Headlines.
* This model can guess the News Headline category of data not necessarily belonging to the same source of the News Headlines dataset.

## Prerequisites

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Running
```
python3 headline_category.py
```

## Dataset

A News dataset consists of following attributes.
* **id** - *ID of the News Headline*
* **category** - *Category of the News Headline*
* **headline** - *The News headline*
* **short_description** - *Short description of the News Article*

Dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset#News_Category_Dataset_v2.json).

## Architecture
![](./model.png)

## Preprocessing steps:

1. Removal of punctuations.
2. Tokenization.

* [json_embedding_news.json](./json_embedding_news.json) file is created to store dictionary of GloVe embeddings for words in headline and short_description.

* [dataset_final.txt](./dataset_final.txt) file is the final input to the model, each line in it is of the form:
```
"headline" + "\t" + "short_description" + "category_index" + "\n"
```
* [category_index.json](./category_index.json) file contains dictionary to convert category to index vice versa.
